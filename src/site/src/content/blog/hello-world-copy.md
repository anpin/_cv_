Welcome to my new website and blog! My name is Pavel Anpin and I've been dabling with technology since I was a baby, gradually progressing in my understanding of technology I've grown into a systems generalist and technical founder who builds scalable IoT infrastructure with F# and NixOS by day, and explores generative multimedia art by night. Currently co-building <a href="https://alerio.net?ref=anpin.fyi" target="_blank">Alerio</a> — a smart-building platform — while hacking on experimental multimedia systems. Here I'll share my personal insights about technology as well as random sets of words I feel like writing. Please excuse any grammatical quirks and spelling mistakes, since English is not my native tongue and many years have passed since I've parttaken official education. Idea for this personal website has been fermenting in the corners of my mind for a long time and has finally manifested into patterns of electricity deep in the big-tech cloud infrastracture, so humans and other forms of intelegence can finally get in touch with me via simple HTTP request! On this cheerful note I'd like to thank you for reading this and until the next one.
