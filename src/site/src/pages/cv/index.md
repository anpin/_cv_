## Summary

Senior Software Engineer with 12+ years designing event-driven platforms for smart buildings, multimedia installations and other cyber-physical systems.

Proven success in building high-performance, scalable, and maintainable systems across domains.

Passionate about functional programming, reproducibility, and distributed architectures. Always open to new challenges - whether consulting, partnering on ambitious ideas, or supporting teams that value thoughtful engineering. 

In my spare time, I enjoy learning new things, cycling, exploring generative visuals, baking and reflecting on the nature of consciousness.
