## Work Experience

### [Alerio](https://alerio.net/?ref=anpin.fyi)

#### Technical Founder | Dec 2022 - Present
- Shipped real-time building control and monitoring platform for incidents, energy usage, and costs.
- Prototyped a C# solution, gathered market and customer feedback and turned it into a full-stack F# platform (Giraffe/ASP.NET Core, Akka.NET, SignalR, Fable, HTMX, Vega, TimescaleDB/PostgreSQL).
- Implemented reproducible, cost-efficient infrastructure with Nix/NixOS and a self-hosted stack (Grafana, ClickHouse, Forgejo, Authentik).
- Built DSL for efficient hardware integration, runtime module registration from text files, automation rules and data pipelines.
- Implemented reactive graph visualization for arbitary data from modules: 50000 sparse datapoints loaded in less than 5 seconds in a WebGL rendered graph. 
- Implemented offline-first voice control over WebRTC for on-prem devices with self-hosted STT/TTS/LLM pipeline for user intent recognition and response, including smart speaker firmware for ESP32.
- Product website and marketing materials, custom build/publish pipeline for A/B testing with openresty serving static files built from different git branches.

### [Independent Contractor](https://anpin.fyi)
#### Self-employed | Dec 2016 - Present

Delivered bespoke software solutions for IoT, AV and enterprise domains. Built and maintained cross-platform apps (Xamarin.Forms/MAUI, Avalonia, ASP.NET Core), implemented CI/CD pipelines, and migrated client systems from C# to F# using Akka.NET, Giraffe, and Avalonia—improving maintainability and scalability. Worked across a wide stack including PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB, Event Sourcing, CQRS, WebRTC, NixOS, and embedded Rust.

Highlights:
- Velonetic: Presentation room control system with custom CMS for Tizen signage, real-time web control, scheduling, transcoding, and integration with Crestron/Biamp/Dante.
- BrightlinkAV: ASP.NET Core backend with Xamarin.Forms → MAUI migration, Azure cloud, and CI/CD automation.
 

### Past Roles
#### 2013–2017

Progressed from intern to Chief Engineer across [8 Ohm Ltd](https://8ohm.ru/), [AudioVideoSystems Ltd](https://audioprofi.ru/), and [IMS Group Ltd](https://www.facebook.com/imsgroup.pro/), delivering end-to-end audiovisual systems for hospitality, universities and commercial environments. Led engineering workflow development and team training; handled pre-sales and client/contractor coordination; and designed, programmed, and commissioned solutions, managing projects from scoping through installation, handover, and training to ensure reliable, high-quality outcomes.

### Open Source Contributions
- [Ported](https://github.com/akkadotnet/Akka.Management/pull/3365) Akka.NET Management DNS-based service discovery from Scala Akka; added async DNS provider, examples, tests, and docs—enabling reliable cluster bootstrapping.
