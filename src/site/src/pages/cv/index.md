# Pavel Anpin, 1992

**Senior Software Engineer | Functional Programming | Distributed Systems**


## Summary


Senior Software Engineer with 12+ years of experience delivering turnkey solutions in smart buildings, audio visual installations and cyber-physical systems.

Proven success in building high-performance, scalable, and maintainable systems across domains.

Passionate about functional programming, reproducibility, and distributed architectures. Always open to new challenges - whether consulting, partnering on ambitious ideas, or supporting teams that value thoughtful engineering.

In my spare time, I enjoy cycling, exploring generative visuals, baking and reflecting on the nature of consciousness.
